When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are working on files from a foriegn computer that you don't want your work
saved locally on, then you would save it directly to GitHub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? Certain pieces of code may not be ready for GitHub. Other pieces might override a local piece when pulling.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones of other peoples work from GitHub to your work on GitHub. Clones copy your work from GitHub to
your local machine, or copies work in you local computer. Branches create a modified copy from the master branch
that doesnt effect the master branch's updates. Depending on which part of a repository, or which repositry you
wish to clone will determien the method.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Having it stored for offline work.
