How did viewing a diff between two versions of 
a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It greatly narrowed down the search area of the error.

How could having easy access to the entire history 
of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
If you make a mistake, one can always go back to a previous version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when 
to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically
saved, like Google Docs does?
Manual saving is more logic based, but prone to user error. 
Auto is not logical based, but will always save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
 multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat
  each file separately?
Saving all files helps if every file was changed. Otherwise you're
some files that havent been changed.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log shows all versions with discriptions and get diff can show you
the differences between two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
 could break something? 
 Should it break, I can return back to a working version easily.

 Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
 All my coding!!!
