When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you are working on files from a foriegn computer that you don't want your work
saved locally on, then you would save it directly to GitHub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? Certain pieces of code may not be ready for GitHub. Other pieces might override a local piece when pulling.
